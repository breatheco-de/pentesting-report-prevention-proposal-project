# üå± How to Start This Project

This exercise aims to consolidate everything learned in the previous three pentesting exercises by proposing mitigation and prevention measures for the detected attacks. The goal is to develop a report that details the identified vulnerabilities, the exploitation techniques used, and the recommendations for preventing future exploits.

This final project will not only reflect your competence in pentesting but also your commitment to continuous security and system improvement.

## üìù Instructions

* Open this URL and fork the repository https://github.com/breatheco-de/pentesting-report-prevention-proposal-project

 ![fork button](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/4GeeksAcademy/blob/master/site/src/static/fork_button.png?raw=true)

A new repository will be created in your account.

* Clone the newly created repository into your localhost computer.
* Once you have cloned successfully, follow the steps below carefully, one by one.

Let's start! ü§ì

- [ ] **Review previous reports**: Ensure you have a clear understanding of the findings from the previous pentesting reports (v1 and v2).
  - **Report v1**: Review the vulnerabilities detected during the reconnaissance phase.
  - **Report v2**: Document the exploitation of vulnerabilities and privilege escalation in both scenarios: the vulnerable machine and the vulnerable website.
- [ ] **Analyze each vulnerability** detected and exploited in the previous reports.
- [ ] **Propose prevention measures**: Develop strategies to prevent the introduction of these vulnerabilities into the system.
  - **Examples**:
    - Secure Development: Implement secure coding practices.
    - Code Review: Establish a code review process to detect flaws before they reach production.
    - Security Policies: Establish policies to avoid unnecessary exposure of services or sensitive information.
- [ ] **Identify mitigation measures** for vulnerabilities that are already present in the system.
- [ ] **Develop practical solutions** that can be applied to reduce the impact of the vulnerabilities.
  - **Examples**:
    - Security Patches: Apply updates and patches that address vulnerabilities.
    - Security Configuration: Modify insecure configurations on servers, applications, and networks.
    - Network Segmentation: Isolate critical services to limit the impact of a potential attack.

### Final Report Writing

- [ ] **Prepare a structured report** that includes:
  - **Table of Contents**: A clear guide to the sections and subsections of the report.
  - **Introduction**: Summary of the objectives and scope of the exercise. Briefly explain the goal of the pentesting conducted (identification of vulnerabilities, regulatory compliance, etc.). Also, describe the general scope, including the areas and systems evaluated.
  - **Approach and Strategy**: Describe the general methodology, but be sure to highlight the differences between the approach used for the machine and the website.
  - **Phases of Pentesting**: Detail the phases for both the machine and the website, indicating the specific tools and techniques used for each. For example, you might have used Nmap, Metasploit for the machine.
  - **Detected Vulnerabilities**: A list of all the vulnerabilities exploited in previous exercises.
  - **Prevention Proposal**: Suggested strategies to prevent the introduction of new vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation Proposal**: Details of the recommended solutions to mitigate existing vulnerabilities.
  - **Mitigation Analysis**: Assessment of the effectiveness of the recommended mitigation measures.
  - **Potential Impact**: Reflection on the impact these measures could have on the overall security of the system.
  - **Conclusion**: Final reflection on the importance of prevention and continuous security.


## üöõ How to deliver this project?

- At the root of the forked project, upload the report in `.pdf` format with the name `pentesting-report.pdf`. Including links to tools and additional resources used in the analysis will be considered a plus. Make sure to include screenshots, detailed descriptions, and any other resources that support your proposals.
